Inspired from "a Python script to extract data out of a DISA STIG Viewer xccdf file to a CSV" @author Michael Joseph Walsh <github.com@nemonik.com> and the original [Github link](https://gist.github.com/nemonik/951a0e55436e0708222b)

> Note: (This was a Python2 implementation that I changed to Python3 and incorporated into `stig_converter.py`)
